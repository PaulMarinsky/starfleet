#### The Application 
###### Background
In early December of 2018 an agreement was reached between Starfleet Service Dogs, inc, and UI/UX designer and developer Paul Marinsky to develop an application that would improve the service dog training program providing handlers with a tool to not only enhance the training experience, but to provide handlers and the organization a means of tracking all phases of service dog training.
