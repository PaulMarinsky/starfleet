#### The Application 
###### Background
In early December of 2018 an agreement was reached between Starfleet Service Dogs, inc, and UI/UX designer and developer Paul Marinsky to develop an application aimed to improve the service dog training experience. The inital application concept was to provide handlers with a means of tracking training progress. A more advanced application would provide Starfleet a resource for improving education and training standards.
